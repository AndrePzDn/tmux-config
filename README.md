# Tmux Configuration Setup

## Author: [AndrePzDn](github.com/AndrePzDn)

## Description

This is my configuration for tmux, a terminal multiplexer that allow us to
create multiple terminal windows in the same session.

## Installation

To install this configuration, you can run the `setup.sh` script. This script
will install tmux for your system and copy the configuration files to your home
directory. And it will install TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager) to manage the plugins
for tmux.

```bash
./setup.sh
```
